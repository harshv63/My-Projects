# ASCII ART GENERATOR

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable (from a total of 128) characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters (beyond the 128 characters of standard 7-bit ASCII). The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general. ASCII art can be created with any text editor, and is often used with free-form languages. Most examples of ASCII art require a fixed-width font (non-proportional fonts, as on a traditional typewriter) such as Courier for presentation

# FOR RUNNING PROJECT
1- Install pycharm software
2- Install important libraries like os, PIL, cv2, math
3- Add the required images videos and fonts in your code as per destination folder
4- Implement this code
5- Run your code in cmd mode or
6- Run in pycharm just pressing shift + F10

# ADDITIONAL TASK - (ASCIIFY_VIDEO)
It can convert an ongoing image into ascii art just by using simple characters
We have used computer vision algoritms and basic capturing and converting the video by frame by frame
Then changing into ASCII ART
